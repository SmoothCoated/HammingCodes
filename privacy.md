# Privacy Policy for Hamming Code App:


### USER INFORMATION

This app does **not** offer registration, login or account creation. So I do **not** collect or store any personal user information like name and address.

### ADVERTISEMENT & IN-APP PURCHASES

This app does **not** offer in-app purchases or show advertisements. I therefore do **not** collect, store, sell or share any information related to this.

### ANALYTICS

If the app crashes while you are using it, then I want to understand what happened. To do this I use Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics, which are Google products.

Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects technical information about any crash event (like the stack trace), and then makes the information anonymous so that I can view it.
Firebase Analytics gives context to the crash reports by showing the user activity prior to the crash, through a "breadcrumb log". This includes information like the approximate location (country/city), and how long the app was open. The data collected by Crashlytics and Analytics is used in an aggregated and anonymized form and is not linked to any individual user.
You can find out more about the processing of personal data in the Firebase Privacy Policy [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
