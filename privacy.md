# Privacy Policy for Hamming Code App:

Last updated: 3 June 2025

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy outlines how the devloper (A.Chester) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Hamming Code App. 

### 2. USER INFORMATION

This App does **not** offer registration, login, or account creation. I therefore do **not** collect any direct Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address, email address, or phone number.

### 3. ANALYTICS & CRASH REPORTING

To help me understand app performance and stability, and to identify and fix issues, I use Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics, which are services provided by Google.

Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects technical information about any app crash event (such as stack traces, device state at the time of crash, and operating system information). This data is automatically pseudonymized (linked to a device identifier rather than your direct identity) to help me analyze and resolve crashes.

Firebase Analytics provides context to crash reports and general insights into app usage. It collects usage data such as:
- User activity: A "breadcrumb log" of user interactions prior to a crash (e.g., screens visited, specific feature usage).
- Approximate location: General location information (e.g., country/city) derived from your device's IP address.
- Device information: Details like device model, operating system, and app version.
- App session data: How long the app was open.

The data collected by both Crashlytics and Analytics is used in an aggregated and pseudonymized form. This means it is linked to a unique device identifier but not to your direct identity, and it helps me understand overall trends and improve the app without identifying specific users.

The purpose of collecting this data is solely for improving the app's stability, performance, and overall user experience.

Data Retention: The pseudonymized data collected by Firebase Analytics is retained for 14 months from the date of collection. Google's own data retention policies apply to data processed by their services.

You can find out more about how Google processes data via Firebase in the Google Privacy Policy, which applies to Firebase: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and also the Firebase Privacy Policy for more technical details: [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

### 4. ADVERTISEMENTS & IN-APP PURCHASES

This App does **not** offer in-app purchases or show advertisements. I therefore do **not** collect, store, sell, or share any information related to this.

### 5. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by updating the date at the top of this Privacy Policy. I advise you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
