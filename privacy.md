# Privacy Policy for Hamming Code App:

Last updated: 3 June 2025

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy describes how J.Smith / Vermillion ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information in connection with your use of the Hamming Code App ("the App").

### 2. USER INFORMATION

This App does **not** offer registration, login, or account creation. We therefore do **not** collect any direct Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, address, email address, or phone number. However, please refer to the "ANALYTICS & CRASH REPORTING" section below for information on indirectly identifiable data (such as device identifiers and approximate location) collected by Firebase Analytics.

### 3. ADVERTISEMENTS & IN-APP PURCHASES

This App does **not** offer in-app purchases or show advertisements. We therefore do **not** collect, store, sell, or share any information related to such activities.

### 4. ANALYTICS & CRASH REPORTING

To help us understand app performance and stability, and to identify and fix issues, we use Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics, which are services provided by Google.

Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects technical information about any app crash event (such as stack traces, device state at the time of crash, and operating system information). This data is automatically pseudonymized (linked to a device identifier rather than your direct identity) to help us analyze and resolve crashes.

Firebase Analytics provides context to crash reports and general insights into app usage. It collects usage data such as:
- User activity: A "breadcrumb log" of user interactions prior to a crash (e.g., screens visited, specific feature usage).
- Approximate location: General location information (e.g., country/city) derived from your device's IP address.
- Device information: Details like device model, operating system, and app version.
- App session data: How long the app was open.

The data collected by both Crashlytics and Analytics is used in an aggregated and pseudonymized form. This means it is linked to a unique device identifier but not to your direct identity, and it helps us understand overall trends and improve the app without identifying specific users.

The purpose of collecting this data is solely for improving the app's stability, performance, and overall user experience.

Data Retention: The pseudonymized data collected by Firebase Analytics is retained for [e.g., 14 months â€“ STATE YOUR ACTUAL CONFIGURED PERIOD IN FIREBASE] from the date of collection. Google's own data retention policies apply to data processed by their services.

You can find out more about how Google processes data via Firebase in the Google Privacy Policy, which applies to Firebase: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and also the Firebase Privacy Policy for more technical details: [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).


### 5. DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS (GDPR & UK GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK GDPR. We, as the data controller, are committed to upholding these rights.

Please note that as our App does not collect your direct Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and primarily processes pseudonymized usage and technical data through Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics, fulfilling some of these rights directly may be limited by the nature of the anonymized and aggregated data we have access to. We cannot directly identify you from the data we process.

Your rights include:

- The Right to Access: You have the right to request copies of your personal data we hold. As noted, we do not hold direct PII, and the analytics data is pseudonymized and aggregated.
- The Right to Rectification: You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete. Since we do not collect direct PII, this right would primarily apply to any data you might have directly provided (which, in your case, is none).
- The Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions. As your data is pseudonymized and aggregated within our analytics, direct individual erasure is generally not feasible from our end. For information on how Google processes data, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy.
- The Right to Restrict Processing: You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
- The Right to Object to Processing: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
- The Right to Data Portability: You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.

To exercise any of these rights, or if you have questions about them, please contact us at vermilion.post@gmail.com. We will respond to your request as promptly as possible.

**Legal Basis for Processing**:
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described in this Privacy Policy is our **legitimate interests**, specifically to:
* Ensure the stable and secure operation of the App.
* Monitor and analyze App usage and performance.
* Identify, diagnose, and fix technical issues and crashes.
* Improve the overall user experience and functionality of the App.

We ensure that these legitimate interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.

**Complaints:**
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection in your country if you believe that our processing of your personal data violates applicable law.
