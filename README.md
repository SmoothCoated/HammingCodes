_A guide to Hamming codes_. These can be used to find or fix errors in data. 
For example, the data stored in RAM (memory) can be checked using Hamming codes.
In this app, error detection and correction are described.
Then a simple example is given, which shows Hamming codes being used to check data.
A version of the algorithm (written in C) can be saved to your device.

The app also lets you calculate Hamming codes for any data width (up to 999 bits), and save the results to your device.
Finally, there is a short description of the arithmetic used for Hamming codes.

This app is free to download and has no adverts.
